# 🧙‍♀️ Sofia’s Engineering Philosophy Checklist

*A living guide for thoughtful, maintainable, and magical code ✨*  
Because clean architecture and kind code are the real spells of engineering 🪄

---

## 🧱 Code Design
- [ ] 🧩 **DRY** — Don’t repeat yourself; reuse logic and avoid duplication.
- [ ] 🪞 **Separation of Concerns** — Each piece of code should have one clear purpose.
- [ ] 💡 **KISS** — Keep it simple and straightforward; clarity beats cleverness.
- [ ] 🧘‍♀️ **YAGNI** — Don’t build what you don’t need (yet).
- [ ] ⚖️ **SOLID (when useful)** — Especially SRP and Dependency Inversion.
- [ ] 🧬 **Composition Over Inheritance** — Combine small pieces; avoid rigid hierarchies.
- [ ] 🚪 **Law of Demeter** — Each layer should only talk to its direct neighbor.

---

## ⚙️ Architecture & Structure
- [ ] 🧠 **Loose Coupling, High Cohesion** — Keep modules independent and internally focused.
- [ ] 🔒 **Encapsulate Complexity** — Hide details behind clean interfaces.
- [ ] 🚨 **Error Handling Discipline** — Anticipate and fail gracefully with clear logs.
- [ ] 🌊 **Predictable Data Flow** — Keep logic linear; avoid side effects and surprises.
- [ ] 🔁 **Idempotent APIs** — Repeated requests should behave consistently.
- [ ] 🚀 **Scalability Awareness** — Design systems that can grow without chaos.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Reliability
- [ ] 🧩 **Testability** — Write code that’s easy to unit test and mock.
- [ ] 🤖 **Automated Tests** — Cover core logic, APIs, and integrations.
- [ ] 🎯 **Determinism** — Same input = same output, no spooky randomness 👻.
- [ ] 💥 **Error Simulation** — Test failure paths and recovery scenarios.

---

## 📦 Codebase Health
- [ ] 📝 **Clear Naming** — Descriptive, consistent names > comments.
- [ ] 🧷 **Consistency** — Keep patterns, style, and structure unified.
- [ ] 🧭 **Documentation** — Explain *why*, not just *what*.
- [ ] 🧹 **Refactoring Habit** — Clean as you go; prevent tech debt buildup.
- [ ] 🕊️ **Version Control Discipline** — Small, logical commits with clear messages.

---

## 🤝 Team & Process
- [ ] 💞 **Empathy for Future Developers** — Write code that’s kind to read.
- [ ] 🔍 **Code Reviews** — Teach, learn, and aim for clarity.
- [ ] 🗣️ **Transparency** — Communicate design intent early.
- [ ] ⚙️ **Continuous Improvement** — Regularly revisit tools, habits, and patterns.
- [ ] 🧱 **Architecture Docs** — Keep diagrams and overviews up to date.
