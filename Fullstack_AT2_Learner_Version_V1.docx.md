| **Project Brief** Read through the brief below take note of the needs and requirements outlined in the brief. |
| **Introduction**  **Bob’s Garage**  Bob Garage is a mechanics workshop that fixes and services cars. His current site shows the history of the garage, the staff that works there and a list of his services and his prices and a home page. The footer contains social links and contact details.  The teacher will be playing the role of the client for this assessment task.  **The problem**  Bob wants a new web site that is trendy and hip.  The website needs to show off the information on his garage and services. The website must contain a way to update the services offered and change images.  The information for the website must be stored in a database. Bob has heard that MySQL is a good database and wants to make use of that for his website  **Instructions:**  This assessment task requires Learners to plan and build a full stack application. There must be an advanced user interface built in React and a server built using Node.js. All data needs to be stored in a database. The application needs to deal with dynamic data and images, as well as content.  Bob wants to update as much of the site as possible without needing to call the webmaster.  Remember that the website should follow industry best practices, privacy and intellectual property legislation, best coding practices and accessibility standards.  This assessment has been divided into X key parts.  Part 1 – Planning and Confirm Design Requirements  Part 2 – Design and Feedback of UI and Architecture Part 3 – Database Design and Data Types Part 4 – Develop Server-Side API  Part 5 – Develop the User Interface  Part 6 – Secure the Application  Part 7 – Testing and Debugging  Part 8 – Final Approval and Signoff  **Business requirements:**   * Database to be used is MySQL * The client requires an API to connect to the database * Pages required: * Home page * About us - (meet the staff – 4 staff, bob, 2 other mechanics and a receptionist/office worker), * Services (lists services and prices), * Login * Register * Admin Dashboard * The site should have authorization and authentication. * Contact details and social links need to be in the footer of the site.   **General API requirements:**   * An API that returns JSON at various endpoints. * The API data must be saved and retrieved from a database. * All 4 core CRUD operations must be used in your application. * Session management must be implemented. * Authentication and Authorization must be implemented. * Some of the endpoints must be secured such as an admin endpoint. * Error responses such as 404 & 500 errors must be created and implemented.   **UI Requirements**   * A responsive framework such as Bootstrap may be used. * HTML and CSS3 are to be used. * Separate style sheet(s) must be used with a responsive framework, or you can build your own framework using SASS. * React is to be used to develop the UI * Client-side validation needs to be implemented * Displaying data is to use appropriate controls, such as text boxes, dropdowns, radio buttons etc.… * Format the data so it is easily understood by the user. * Need to include pages listed in the business requirements. * Multimedia elements need to be included (video, images, etc…) * All data should be validated before sending it to the server. * The UI must be able to be customized, i.e. light and dark modes * The UI must be able to be personalized, i.e. favourite list. * The UI must be able to store a user profile to save options like sorting, dark mode, favorites   **Security Requirements/Plan:**   * All data must be validated before saving to the database. * Authentication and Authorization must take place before any data is saved to the database. * Application secrets must be stored in environmental variables. * It is recommended that a module such as helmet be used to further protect the application and database.   **Coding standards and maintainability**   * JavaScript / TypeScript coding standards need to be adhered to. * All code should be commented clearly. * Functions should be labeled with purpose and parameters. * All code files should be labeled with comments that: have the author, the purpose of the file and version. * JSDoc may be used to document your API.   **Other Standards**   * HTML & HTML Standards must be adhered to wherever possible. * CSS Standards must be adhered to wherever possible. * Privacy and intellectual property standards must be adhered to. * Accessibility standards must be adhered to. |
